The findings from project 1 are as follows:

1.	Monthly Spend of Each Customer: The analysis shows that monthly spending patterns vary significantly across customers, with some customers demonstrating consistent spending while others not.
2.	Monthly Repayment of Each Customer: Similar to spending, repayment patterns vary. Customers generally repay a significant portion of their spending each month.
3.	Highest Paying 10 Customers: The top 10 highest paying customers are identified, with their total spending significantly higher than others, indicating a small segment of customers contributing disproportionately to overall spend.
4.	Segment Spending: Analysis of spending by segment reveals that the 'Normal Salary' segment contribute the most to overall spending, suggesting these segment customers are the most valuable in terms of spend.
5.	Age Group Spending: The age group 65+ spends the most money, followed by the 46-55 age-group. Younger customers (18-25) spend the least.
6.	Most Profitable Segment: The 'Salaried_Pvt' segment is the most profitable, followed by the 'Normal Salary' segment. Profitability is calculated based on spend minus repayment.
7.	Category Spending: Customers spend the most on 'Petrol', followed by 'Camera' and 'Food'. This indicates essential and lifestyle-related expenses are the primary drivers of spend.
8.	Interest on Due Amounts: Imposing an interest rate of 2.9% on due amount generates additional income, impacting overall profitability positively.
9.	Monthly Profit for the Bank: Monthly profits vary but show a trend of gradual increase and decrease, influenced by spending, repayment patterns, and interest on due amounts.
10.	Spending Over Credit Limit: Some customers have spent more than their credit limit in certain months, indicating potential risk and the need for better credit management.
